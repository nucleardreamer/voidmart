            ol 
              li By completing this transaction, you acknowledge and accept that you are willingly exchanging an intangible part of yourself for the chosen power or ability. The exact nature and extent of this exchange may not be fully understood or disclosed.
              li The use of your newly acquired power is solely at your own risk. We are not responsible for any unintended consequences, moral dilemmas, or existential crises that may arise from the exercise of your chosen ability.
              li The duration and potency of your power may vary based on factors beyond our control, including but not limited to your own belief, the alignment of celestial bodies, and the whims of the universe itself.
              li In the event that you experience any adverse effects, such as a loss of sense of self, a blurring of reality, or a gnawing feeling of emptiness, please consult with a metaphysical practitioner or a trusted spiritual guide. Our customer support team is not equipped to handle such inquiries.
              li We reserve the right to revoke or modify your power at any time, should we deem it necessary for the greater good or the maintenance of the cosmic balance. In such cases, no refunds or exchanges will be offered.
              li By agreeing to these terms and conditions, you waive any right to hold us liable for the consequences of your actions or the impact of your power on your life, relationships, or sense of reality.
              li These terms and conditions are subject to change without notice, as the very nature of the powers we offer is fluid and ever-shifting. It is your responsibility to stay informed of any updates or modifications to this agreement.
              li In the event of a dispute arising from the use or misuse of your power, the matter will be resolved through a binding metaphysical arbitration process, the details of which will be revealed only to those who partake in it.
              li By proceeding with this transaction, you affirm that you are of sound mind and spirit, and that you are prepared to embrace the unknown and the unknowable. Should you have any doubts or reservations, we strongly advise you to reconsider your purchase.
              li Lastly, we remind you that the true cost of power is often hidden in plain sight, and that the price you pay may extend far beyond the scope of this transaction. Proceed at your own peril, and may the consequences be ever in your favor.
